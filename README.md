# big-transcendental-numbers
transcendental numbers in different sizes

Numbers created with [y-cruncher](http://www.numberworld.org/y-cruncher/).

Because the Files are to large to upload on Github, and they are even sometimes to large to open, I coded a python Script that divides the big files into smaller Files.
