# big-transcendental-numbers
transcendental numbers in different sizes

Numbers created with [y-cruncher](http://www.numberworld.org/y-cruncher/).

Because the files are to large to upload on Github, and they are even sometimes to large to open, I coded a Python Script that divides the big files into smaller files. 
To get the original File, you can run

`python splitter.py ./DIRECTORY_FROM_CONSTANT/ result.txt -m j`

To get more Info, type

`python splitter.py -h`
